    These articles are used by LAMsight but are maintained in ILR:

      * Quality of Life and Pulmonary Function (lam-qol-study-consent-form) 
      * Quality of Life and Pulmonary Function 2 (lam-qol-study-ilr-data-use-form)
      * Study Introduction (lam-qol-study-articles)
      * Study Proposal (lam-qol-study-articles)

1.2 Create centers, users, and forum articles

    (create-ilr-beta)

    Give admin permission to one account and verify you can connect to
    the new server instance.

      (add-permission (get-user "someuser") :admin)

1.3 Upload Lymphatics article to Docs tab

    Directory: "ILR"
    Filename: "lrb.2009.0028.lowlink.pdf_v03.pdf"

1.4 Create study, surveys, and test data

    (create-ilr-arr/pft-study :owner (get-user "kmcorbett"))
    (create-ilr-arr/pft-data)

2. LAMsight

2.1 Create study and surveys

    (create-lamsight-qol/pft-study :owner (get-user "kmcorbett"))

      * Quality of Life and Pulmonary Function 2 (lam-qol-study-ilr-data-use-form)

    These were converted from PDF

      * Study Introduction (lam-qol-study-articles)
      * Study Proposal (lam-qol-study-articles)

2.3 Upload Lymphatics article to Docs tab

    Directory: "ILR"
    Filename: "lrb.2009.0028.lowlink.pdf_v03.pdf"

2.4 Update "Latest news" with Pulmonary Quality of Life study
    recruitment banner. Text as follows:

    The following new study is looking for participants: 

    **Pulmonary Function and Quality of Life:**  Because there is currently
    no effective treatment or cure for LAM, maintaining quality of life
    is especially important.  We are interested in studying how the
    severity of LAM affects the quality of life of the worldwide LAM
    community.  This information will form an important baseline for
    future LAM treatment trials.  In addition, this study aims to
    determine the accuracy of patient entry of pulmonary function test
    results into web-based collection forms in order to potentially open
    up new avenues of future LAM research that rely more heavily upon self-report.
